# Video stats - Chrome Extension

Video metrics overlayed on any video element within the DOM. The overlay box updates with every update on the video element (depends on `timeupdate`), and displays the following metrics,
* Viewport size
* Video resolution
* Dropped frames
* DRM (to confirm if it works)
